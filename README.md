This Repository contains a lab work made in the context of my Decision Trees course. It contains two exercices, one R script for each, that leverage the same data base to build a decision model (1st exercice) and a Random Forest model (2nd exercice).
In this project I namely tackle topics of parameters optimization and cross validation. I implement a manual version of these technics to develop a deep understanding of it. Other topics are also studied as ROC curves, confusion matrix and pruning.
