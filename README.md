### Purpose and Scope
This repository contains a lab work completed as part of my Decision Trees course. It includes two exercises, each with its own R script, using the same dataset to build a decision tree model (Problem 1) and a random forest model (Problem 2).

### Key Concepts Covered
- Parameter optimization and cross-validation, with manual implementations of these techniques to gain a deeper understanding.
- ROC curves
- Confusion matrices
- Pruning decision trees

### Repository Structure:
- Work Assignement:     the detailed instructions and requirements for this lab project on decision trees and random forests
- Decision-Trees.R:     the R code I created to implement the decision tree for Problem I, along with comments on the results obtained
- Random-Forest.R:      the R code I created to implement the Random Forest for Problem II, along with comments on the results obtained
- 7 bank-marketing.csv: Dataset used in Problems I and II to build the models
  
### How to execute the code?
