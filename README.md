This repository contains a lab work completed as part of my Decision Trees course. It includes two exercises, each with its own R script, using the same dataset to build a decision tree model (Exercise 1) and a random forest model (Exercise 2).
In this project, I address topics such as parameter optimization and cross-validation, implementing manual versions of these techniques to gain a deeper understanding. Additional topics covered include ROC curves, confusion matrices, and pruning.

Structure:
- Work Assignement: the detailed instructions and requirements for this lab project on decision trees and random forests
- Decision-Trees.R: the R code I created to implement the decision tree for Problem I, along with comments on the results obtained
- Random-Forest.R:  the R code I created to implement the Random Forest for Problem II, along with comments on the results obtained
